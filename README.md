# GreenCoffeeWebCrawler
Web crawler to gather green coffee data to help buying decisions. 
I wrote these programs before taking any Python Courses and based on teaching myself from reading articles. 
If I wrote these programs now after learning top-down design, they may look different and run more efficiently. 
The programs take around a one to two minutes to run and require the following Python libraries: time, requests, BeautifulSoup, and xlsxwriter.
The Coffee Bean Corral program also required the math library.
