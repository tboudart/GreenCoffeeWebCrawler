# GreenCoffeeWebCrawler
I developed Python programs to scrape data from multiple unroasted coffee bean vendors and structured it in Excel tables. I initally used Python libraries Beautiful Soup, Requests, and XlsxWriter to gather the necessary information to help guide my coffee buying decisions. When I learned more, I improved the code's performance for 
Sweet Maria's web crawler by over 70% by implementing Pandas. I also have experience building web crawlers with Python by extending the HTMLParser class.
