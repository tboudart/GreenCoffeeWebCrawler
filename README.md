# GreenCoffeeWebCrawler
I developed Python programs to scrape data from multiple unroasted coffee bean vendors and structured it in Excel tables. I used python libraries Beautiful Soup, Requests, and XlsxWriter to gather the necessary information to help guide my coffee buying decisions. A key feature used to help guide my buying decision was the cupping score, which is calculated differently based on vendor. I, therefore, standardized the different vendors' cupping scores into Z-scores so I could compare the price per cupping score across vendors. I also have experience building web crawlers with Python by extending the HTMLParser class.

The programs take around a one to two minutes to run and require the following Python libraries: time, requests (2.25.1), BeautifulSoup (4.9.3), and xlsxwriter (1.3.8).
The Coffee Bean Corral program also required the math library.
